# Bioimplantable_Device

For a brain implant, there are several limitations in terms of size, power and mechanical properties that may be considered. With the use of optoelectronic techniques, we achieved an ultra-small and fully implantable device that could be used for neurostimulation techniques. Moreover, a Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) system for powering the final LED was also devised to provide a demonstration. The proposed design in this study combines optimal size and practicality given the mechanical constraints of this implant typology. We have applied a modular design approach to the design of this device considering three modules: antenna, conditioner circuit and shank. The implant was designed by using a flexible substrate such as Polyimide. Thin biocompatible encapsulation was also provided for chronic implantation. In addition, simulation of mechanical forces acting on the implant and shank will be carried out to validate a viable shank conformation-encapsulation combination that will safely work under operational stress with a satisfactory margin of safety.
