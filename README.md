# Bioimplantable_Device

This project consists of several modules that together will provide a proposed device based on optoelectronics for the treatment of brain diseases, specially, epilepsy. Thus, the device includes a circuit design based on a wireless power transfer that will light up a LED which is going to be the trigger of the neurostimulation. The device will be fully biocompatible and protected according to all the safety regulations for further testing in vivo.
